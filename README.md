# fauxcurrence

This R package generates sets of randomised occurrences (long & lat coordinates) for one or more species with a spatial structure (within- and between-species distances) matching that of an observed set of coordinates. These can be used to define null expectations to test hypotheses in ecology and biogeography.

To install, use:

```R
devtools::install_github("ogosborne/fauxcurrence")
```
